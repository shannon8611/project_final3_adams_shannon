			<h1>ABOUT US</h1>
			<h2>Our Mission</h2>
			<section class="mission">
				<p class="mission-p">At Cat Nap Pet Sitting we believe in a safe and happy world where cats get their way every day. This means enabling your cat to live life to its fullest.  We also believe that your cat should be in a “free range”, stress-free environment with one-on-one care, which is why we provide in-home pet sitting where your cat will be free of the physical and emotional stress of a kennel, boarding or daycare facility. So, when you’re away you’ll have the peace of mind knowing your cat can stay in the safety and comfort of your home and maintain their normal routine. We believe finding a reliable, professional pet sitter should be easy. So we match your pet with a professional pet sitter who is a highly experienced animal lover who is background checked, insured and comes with glowing reviews. We also assign a back-up sitter just in case anything comes up we’ll have your tail covered!</p>
